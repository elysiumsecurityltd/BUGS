THIS IS A NEW CONTEST !
This contest cancelled the previous one from the 01 August 2000.
The reason why I am changing the rules is because after many discussions on the newsgroup
sci.crypt it seems it would have been too difficult to win the previous contest with the information
I was giving away. It was not completely a "real world" contest.

For these reasons I have decided to make this contest easier to win and therefore more
of a "real world" test.

BUGS CONTEST Number 2
---------------------

Prize               : 50 English pounds
Start of the contest: 19 September 2000
End of the contest  : 19 September 2001

To test the strenght of this algorithm, I've decided to run a contest.
Because this is a free software and I created it during my free time,
I can't offer a lot of money. However I hope that this will push more
people to try to crack my algorithm.
This new BUGS contest cancelled the previous BUGS contest from the 01 August 2000
The 2 ciphers texts are the same than for the previous contest.

RULES
-----

Information given:

- 2 cipher texts which have been crypted with the same KEY
- the 2 original clear texts
- The size of the key used: 256 bits
- Each clear text have been crypted using different parameters values (block shuffle/block crypt)

In order to win and claim your prize, you need to:
(me = Sylvain Martinez)

- Find the key and the parameters used to crypt the 2 clear texts.

- Send me a report explaining how you did it 

- Send me the source of your application which found the key and parameters

- Your key has to be the same than the one I used to crypt the files 

- You need to send me your answer before the 19 September 2001

- In the event that many people send me a solution to find the key, then the  
  quickest and most generic application will win.

- Pleople who sent me a solution will have their name listed on the web site
  and their application available only if they want it to be (as it might give hints for other competitors)

- The winner will be annonced after the 19th of september 2001 (within a week)
 
- If nobody can crack my algorithm and find the key/parameters, the solution
  will be posted on the Web Site: http://www.bcrypt.com after the 
  19th September 2001
