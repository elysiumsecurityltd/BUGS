I CONFIGURATION
---------------

>make your_os

where your_os can be: linux, solaris, bsd, openbsd
If your OS is not in this list just try one of them, you
may have to change few things though. If you do have to
please contact me and I will add your OS to the list.

II COMPILATION
--------------

>make all

This will create the binaries in bugs-[VERSION]/bin/

To test if the compilation was OK do:

> make test

Even if this test fails it doesn't mean you can't crypt/encrypt
but it may means the BUGS library will me
for more information.


III USE OF THE APPLICATIONS
---------------------------

Please read the HOWTO in the doc directory.
Most of the application accept the -help flag and display
all the different options available.
