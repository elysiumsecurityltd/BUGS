This is the FULL English documentation of the BUGS project.

You can find an introduction to cryptography as well as the full BUGS Technical
Documentation. 
You can either use the index/html in this directory or the fulldoc/index.html

The fulldoc/dev_english.txt and fulldoc/dev_french.txt documentations are a listing
of the different functions you can use in your own program to use the BUGS algorithm
library. But let's face it, the best way to learn is to look at the different
applications which are in this package.

You can find my CV in the "cv" directory.

You can find in the "history" directory the first documentation 
I ever written for this project, back in 1995. This is only in French.
I leave it for ... sentimental reason ;o)
I just like to remimber how far I have gone from the original goal
I had in 1995. In a way... the idea is still the same.

Regards,
Sylvain.
