       USE THESE PROGRAMS AND LIBRARY AT YOUR OWN RISK !

       I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY POSSIBLE DAMAGE MADE

NOTE 
----

!! THE LIBRARY VERSIONS FROM --- 4.0.0 --- 
   ARE NOT COMPATIBLE WITH THE OLDER VERSIONS !! 


For the latest information about this project please go to the official
project home page 

This new version is NOT compatible with the old versions (1.x, 2.x, 3.x).
PLEASE READ THE CHANGES and DEVELOPPER DOC FILES !
as you will have to recompile/change your applications to use this new library. 

The "cryptedtext" file is there for the `make test`
The original file was: "If you can see this BUGS is working !"

This project is "OPEN SOURCE" and under the GNU/GPL License. This means you
can use it for free. However you must respect the following conditions:
(Based on the cryptlib license example)

 - You must give the authors credit in your software and/or documentation:
   Sylvain Martinez

 - If you make any changes to the code, you should send a copy of the changes to
   the author or authors to allow them to integrate them into the code. This is
   to allow a central consistent version to be maintained.

 - Any software you create with this code may not be merely a set or subset of 
   BUGS, with or without minor added functionality or a different interface. 
   In particular you can't distribute BUGS (or any modified form of it) as your
   own encryption product. This is to stop people adding their own wrappers
   and selling it as "their" encryption product.  


CONTEST (2015 update: context closed)
-------

The 2 contests are now over and nobody managed to decipher the crypted files
and win the 100 GBP. They were both running for almost 2 years. 
Please refer to the BUGS project web page for the solutions.

I might start a new contest soon.

For more information please read the README file in the contest/ directory


INTRODUCTION
------------

Please read the documentation in the doc/ directory before
asking me questions about the algorithm !

This new library version is named "IBIZA"

This package includes a C library and some sample programs that 
demonstrate that this library is ... powerful !
It has now been tested for years and I received many reports highliting
any weaknesses found. This library has reach a strong security level now.

It is a cryptography library, you can crypt any type of data.
Your key length to crypt is ... unlimited :)
It is a PRIVATE KEY Algorithm.
it is also a DYNAMIC CRYPTOGRAPHY ALGORITHM
I may do later a PUBLIC KEY Algorithm.

You can generate passwords, manage users, hide text in file, 
have a secure chat, etc

In fact, this project became one of my first interest !

Thanks to everybody who've shown me their support !
even a small email is always welcome :O)
thank you !

All the comments are welcome ! 
So please, just let me know what you think about this application,  
and even better, about the crypt algorithm. 

For any comments, bugs report, support, send me an email 

please, add [BUGS] at the begining of your subject if you 
want a quick answer.


GREETINGS
---------

BIG THANKS TO:
  
  M.:     Thanks for your support and understanding!

  Simon Huot: Thanks for the really good work you've done on analysing the
              security of BUGS v.3.x 
              You found many weaknesses and gave me a lot of improvement
              ideas. This new version (4.0.0) has been done because of 
              you ! ;o)

  Trevor Tippins: Your comments on my algorithm have been really valuable
                  and really motivated me to carry on improving it !

  GNU Team : Thanks for all your free products !
 
  LINUX team : Computer world without linux ?? ahah let me laugth :)

  KDE's Team : Thanks for your wonderfull and really useful Windows Manager 

  Emanuel Bouvier : For your help in Delphi and your free beers at the madison 
  
  Stephane Guelfo : Your help has been very helpfull many years ago, for 
                    the bits swapping !

  Mr Oswald : Even if I have only 10 minutes to speak when I have a meeting 
              with you about my algorithm (hum ...), thanks for the enhancement
              idea you told me (bits operation part, and some improvements of my
              bilateral swap part) 

  Stephan Legrand : Who sent me a patch for BSD OS.
  
  J. Ellis: Thanks for your help in the documentation, and for your
               friendship

  F. Martinez: Thanks for the official bcrypt and BUGS logos !
                    They are great !!!

  T. Martinez : The last, but not the least.
                     well, little brother, if you didn't pushed me to do
                     a crypt's algorithm I would have probably never done one.
                     He has created a windows application using the BUGS
                     library it is on the BUGS official web site and it's
                     called: winbugspro
                     Ok, let's speak a bit more :)
                     My little brother has been programming
                     since he was 7 years old. after having reproduced
                     The Windows 95 GUI on his Amiga when he was 12 years old, 
                     an Artificial Intelligence module, a 3d vector drawing 
                     convertor is now working on some DELPHI components 
                     I bet, we will hear about you soon, brother ...
