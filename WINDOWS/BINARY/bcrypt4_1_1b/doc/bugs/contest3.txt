THIS IS A NEW CONTEST BASED ON THE NEW BUGS 4.0.0 LIBRARY !

---------------------
BUGS CONTEST Number 3 
---------------------

Prize               : 50 English pounds
Start of the contest: 19 November 2000
End of the contest  : 19 November 2001

To test the strenght of this algorithm, I've decided to run a contest.
Because this is a free software and I created it during my free time,
I can't offer a lot of money. However I hope that this will push more
people to try to crack my algorithm.

RULES
-----

Information given:

- 2 cipher texts which have been crypted with the same KEY
- the 2 original clear texts
- ALL THE PARAMETERS used to crypt the file 
- Both files have been crypted with the SAME parameters and KEY
- The 2 files has been crypted using the BSSL 5 (VERY HIGH SECURITY)
  which means:
  Keylength = 512 bits
  Key buffer = 32
  Dynamic Buffer, Dynamic Round, Dynamic Swap, Dynamic Shuffle Block
  Power = 4
  Default Round = 4
  Block Crypt = 0 (each file considered as ONE big block)
  Block Shuffle = 4 bytes 

In order to win and claim your prize, you need to:
(me = Sylvain Martinez)

- Find a COMMON key that can decrypt the 2 cipher files.

- Send me a report explaining how you did it 

- Send me the source of your application which found the key and parameters

- Your key doesn't have anymore to be the same one than the one I used, but 
  the key MUST be able to decrypt the 2 crypted files.

- You need to send me your answer before the 19 November 2001

- In the event that many people send me a solution to find the key, then the  
  quickest and most generic application will win.

- Pleople who sent me a solution will have their name listed on the web site
  and their application available only if they want it to be (as it might give hints for other 
  competitors)

- The winner will be annonced within a month I received the solution
 
- If nobody can crack my algorithm and find the key/parameters, the solution
  will be posted on the Web Site after the 
  19th November 2001

- Last but IMPORTANT thing, hacking into my computer, frightening me, etc
  won't make you a winner ;o)
  You need to find an application which cracks the BUGS algorithm.

- Good luck ! :O)
