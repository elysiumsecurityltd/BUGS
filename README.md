This is a hobby project of Sylvain Martinez and should only be seen as such.

We would not recommend using this algorithm for commercial reasons or to protect commercial data. 

The rule we use at ELYSIUMSECURITY when it comes to cryptography is .... do not create your own algorithm!
Instead, you should use a well known algorithm for which its implementation has been reviewed/vetted by peers.

Having said that, creating your own algorithm and having tested by the communauty can be a fun project!
It was started in 1996 and was last properly updated in the early 2000, it however still compiles on almost all modern Unix based system!
